### Git set-up
You will need git in order to contribute to this project. While the client is optional if you are going to use **GitHub Desktop**, it is recommendable that you install the Git bash too so you can perform git command in case of need.

You can download the Git installer for Windows [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win). *

### GitHub Desktop set-up (optional but recommended)

### Arduino set-up

**For Windows 10 users**, you can download Arduino directly from the [Microsoft Store App](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4RSD8).

If you don't have Windows 10 or simply would like to install Arduino from the source you can do it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). *

### Teensyduino set-up

Once you have the repository cloned into your machine we will open it with **Visual Studio Code**.

To do so, just open Visual Studio Code, go to "**File** > **Open Folder**" or just hit "**Cntrl + K**" or "**Cntrl + O**".

Then, look for the folder containing your local version of the repository.

You should have somethis like this:

The first thing that you need to do is to use your own **c_cpp_properties.json** file
