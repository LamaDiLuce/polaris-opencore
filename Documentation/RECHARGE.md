# Star Core Recharge

While the saber is charging with the power switch is "on":

- There will be one (1) blink of 500ms on the blade each 20 seconds.
- Once the saber battery has been charged, five (5) blinks will be on the blade each 40 seconds.
- Blink colors are pre-defined and cannot be changed by the final user.

Recharge will happen even if the switch is "off." (Just by connecting the saber to a USB with voltage) There will not be visual indications of the charge status, however.
