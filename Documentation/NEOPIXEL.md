# NeoPixel Blade

It is possible to use either the classic RGBW LED or a NeoPixel strip that fits into the blade.

To put the firmware into NeoPixel mode, uncomment the `ENABLE_NEOPIXEL` definition in `CoreLoader.ino`.

## Pinout

The NeoPixel Strip has three wires and can be hooked like this:
1) 5V: +VBAT
2) Din: Red (can be changed with NEO_PIN definition if needed)
3) GND: LED RGBW COM
